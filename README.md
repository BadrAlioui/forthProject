## Manual Testing:

[Manual Testing Documentation](https://github.com/BadrAlioui/forthProject/blob/master/TESTING.md)

## Automated Testing and Code Coverage

To ensure the application runs smoothly and reliably, extensive automated tests were written for key components like forms, views, and models. These tests help maintain the overall quality of the project.

### Code Coverage

Using the `coverage.py` tool, I measured the test coverage of the project. The results show an overall coverage of **over or equal to 90%**, highlighting that the most critical parts of the application are well-tested.

| Component | Coverage |
| --------- | -------- |
| Views     | 90%      |
| Models    | 100%     |
| Forms     | 100%     |
| Overall   | 96%      |

### Helpful Resources

The course [Unit Testing in Django](https://netninja.dev/courses/unit-testing-in-django/) by [Net Ninja](https://netninja.dev/) was incredibly helpful in improving my understanding of testing in Django. It provided practical guidance on how to write better tests and achieve high coverage.

## Deployment

The booking system is hosted on Heroku. To deploy your own version:

#### Deploying a Django Project on Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform service that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. Here is how to use it:

1. Create an account or log in to Heroku.
2. On the dashboard, click on **"New"** and select **"Create new app"**.
3. Give the app a unique name and select the region closest to you. Then click **"Create app"** to confirm.

#### Settings

##### Update `settings.py`

##### 1. Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS`:

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-heroku-app.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']

## Bug Fixes

1. **Image Loading Issues**: Modified the path to access images using relative or absolute paths to fix image loading issues.
2. **Reservation Past Date Bug**: Added validation to prevent users from making reservations for past dates.
3. **CSS Issues**: Consolidated all CSS into `styles.css` to avoid confusion caused by inline styles.

## Future Enhancements

-   **Filtering Feature**: Possibility to add menus.
-   **Online Payment**: Not available for now, but could be added later.
